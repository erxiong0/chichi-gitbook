## Summary of Notation  
  
Capital letters are used for random variables, whereas lower case letters are used for the values of random variables and for scalar functions. Quantities that are required to be real-valued vectors are written in bold and in lower case (even if random variables). Matrics are bold capitals.  
  
| Symbol             | Meaning                                                                                       |
|:-------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| $s \in \mathcal{S}$  | States                                                                           |
| $a \in \mathcal{A}$  | Actions                                                                          |
| $r \in \mathcal{R}$ | Rewards.                                                                          |
| $S_t, A_t, R_t$      | State, action, and reward at time step $t$ of one trajectory. Occasionally I may use $$(s_t, a_t, r_t)$$ as well. |
