## Introduction

The **Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)** algorithm[[1]](#references), introduced in 2017, addresses critical limitations of policy gradient methods in reinforcement learning by incorporating a **trust region constraint** to enable stable learning of complex policies.

### Main Idea  
In TRPO, an objective function is maximized subject to a constraint on the size of the policy update. Specifically,  
  
$$
\begin{aligned}
&\underset{\theta}{\rm maximize}\ \hat{\mathbb{E}}_t\left[\frac{\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{\rm old}}(a_t|s_t)}\hat{A_t}\right]\\
&{\rm subject\ to}\ \hat{\mathbb{E}}_t\left[{\rm KL}[\pi_{\theta_{\rm old}}(\cdot|s_t),\pi_\theta(\cdot|s_t)]\right]\leq\delta
\end{aligned}
$$

Here, $\theta_{\rm old}$ is the vector of policy parameters before the update. This problem can efficiently be approximately solved using the conjugate gradient algorithm, after making a linear approximation to the objective and a quadratic approximation to the constraint.  
  
From theory perspective, TRPO actually suggests using a penalty instead of a constraint, i.e., solving the unconstrained optimization problem  
  
$$\underset{\theta}{\rm maximize}\ \hat{\mathbb{E}}\left[\frac{\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{\rm old}}(a_t|s_t)}\hat{A}_t-\beta\ {\rm KL}\left[\pi_{\theta_{\rm old}}(\cdot|s_t), \pi_\theta(\cdot|s_t)\right]\right]$$

for some coefficient $\beta$. TRPO uses a hard constraint rather than a penalty because it is hard to choose a single value of $\beta$ that performs well across different problems -- or even within a single problem, where the characteristics change over the course of learning. Hence, to achieve goal of a first-order algorithm that emulates the monotonic improvement of TRPO, experiments show that it is not sufficient to simply choose a fixed penalty coefficient $\beta$ and optimize the penalized objective equation with SGD; additional modifications are required.  
  
## Practical Algorithm
### Conjugate Gradient Method (CG Method)  
To solve equation  

$$Ax =b\tag{1}$$

where  
- $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ is a symmetric positive-definite metrix  
- $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$ is unknown vectors
- $b\in\mathbb{R}^n$ is a constant vector  
  
We transfer equation $(1)$ into a quadratic function minimization problem:  
  
$$\min_x\ f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^TAx-b^Tx\tag{2}$$

and the gradient is $\nabla f(x) = Ax -b$. When $\nabla f(x)=0$, we have $Ax=b$.  
  
*Tips: Implementation are shown as follows:  

Initialization:  
  
$$x_0, r_0 = b - A x_0, p_0 = r_0$$

Iteration:
1. $\alpha_k = \frac{r_k^T r_k}{p_k^T A p_k}$  
   
2. $x_{k+1} = x_k + \alpha_k p_k$  
   
3. $r_{k+1} = r_k - \alpha_k A p_k$  
   
4. Check $\| r_{k+1} \|^2 < \epsilon$, if yes then stop  
   
5. $\beta_k = \frac{r_{k+1}^T r_{k+1}}{r_k^T r_k}$
   
6. $p_{k+1} = r_{k+1} + \beta_k p_k$
